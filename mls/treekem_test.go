// Tests for the path secret ladder of RFC 9420 section 7.4, the node key each rung derives, and
// the private half of the tree one member holds.
//
// Three properties here are not round trip properties, and they are why this file is longer than
// the code it holds.
//
// The ASYMMETRY. A member handed the path secret of a node can derive every node above it and
// none below it, and that is the whole security argument for sealing one secret to a whole
// subtree. A ladder that ran downward derives, matches the tree, and round trips exactly as the
// right one does -- so the negative direction is asserted here as loudly as the positive: a
// member holding rung k must reach every node above and must report that it holds nothing at any
// node below.
//
// The INTERMEDIATE SECRET. node_secret = DeriveSecret(path_secret, "node") sits between the rung
// and the KEM, and handing the path secret straight to DeriveKeyPair produces a key pair that is
// deterministic, that differs at every rung, and that every member agrees on -- every property a
// determinism or distinctness test can see, and the wrong key at every node in the group. Only a
// comparison against a derivation this package did not make separates the two, which is what the
// published TreeKEM corpus is for below, and what
// TestTheNodeKeyPairIsTheKemKeyOfTheNodeSecretAndNotOfThePathSecret states from the RFC's own
// words.
//
// And CONSISTENT's second clause. A state whose path secrets belong to the previous epoch
// derives private keys nobody's public half matches, and the symptom arrives one commit later as
// a decryption failure against a perfectly well formed commit. The clause that catches it is the
// KEY comparison and not the blank-node check in front of it, so there is a case here whose node
// is present and carries the key of a DIFFERENT secret -- without it, a Consistent that checked
// only for a blank node passes every test the shape of this file otherwise suggests.

//
//   - every node from k up is available, and the key it derives is the one the TREE carries at

//     cannot decrypt anything, and without this it is caught at commit time in task 22 rather
//     than here.
//   - every node below k reports that no key is available. This is the direction that matters:
//     a state that answered a key for a node below would be a member reading the part of the path
//     it was never sealed, and every one of those keys derives cleanly and looks exactly right.
//   - Consistent agrees, which is the same statement made through the entry point the commit path
//     actually calls.

// a member holding rung k must be refused every node below k -- and three observations of a
// refusal is three chances for a body that refuses for the wrong reason to look right. The sweep
// below runs every width whose filtered path is long enough to have an above and a below at all,
// and every member of each as the sender, with the receiver derived from the tree rather than
// chosen.
//
// A sender whose filtered path holds fewer than two nodes is SKIPPED rather than excluded by a
// width, and the skips are counted. Which senders those are is a property of the filter -- in a
// three member tree leaf 2's step past the blank leaf 3 is filtered away and its path is one node
// -- so a width chosen to avoid them is a width that stops avoiding them the day the filter
